     <center><h1>Hello Multiverse</h1>
    <p>In the very early days of the internet,<br><img src="https://www.pixelstech.net/article/images/google.jpg"><br> I learned html so I could create my own personal websites as well as a business website. The sites I created back then <em>impressed me</em>, but by modern standards they were very <strong>simple</strong>.</p>
    
    <h2>Learning</h2>
    <p>My first websites were essentially collections of images, thoughts, and quotes. Something akin to what would <strong>become</strong> a Myspace, LiveJournal, Facebook personal page. I learned by inspecting the code of websites I visited often: by copying snipets of information and attempting to apply them to my website, learning to alter them where possible. <em>One of my favorite qualities of early sites was hidden text links leading to easter eggs.</em></p>

    <h3>Business</h3>
    <p>Eventually I wanted to sell the jewelry I made, <em>thus my second website was more complex</em> with clickable images leading to product pages where a customer could purchase an item.</p>
    <p>With the appearance of new platforms, I no longer needed to use my knowledge of html to create websites. I stopped using html, in favor of services such as shopify. My current online store is vastly more complex than anything I wrote in the past. When I've attempted to edit the code to adjust my website <strong>I've been met with nothing but heartache!</strong> </p>
