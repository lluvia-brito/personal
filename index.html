        I learned html so I could create my own personal websites as well as a
        business website. The sites I created back then <em>impressed me</em>,
        but by modern standards they were very <strong>simple</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>Learning</h2>
      <p>
        My first websites were essentially collections of images, thoughts, and
        quotes. Something akin to what would <strong>become</strong> a Myspace,
        LiveJournal, Facebook personal page. I learned by inspecting the code of
        websites I visited often: by copying snipets of information and
        attempting to apply them to my website, learning to alter them where
        possible.

          >One of my favorite qualities of early sites was hidden text links
          leading to easter eggs.</em

        Eventually I wanted to sell the jewelry I made,
        <em>thus my second website was more complex</em> with clickable images
        leading to product pages where a customer could purchase an item.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the appearance of new platforms, I no longer needed to use my
        knowledge of html to create websites. I stopped using html, in favor of
        services such as shopify. My current online store is vastly more complex
        than anything I wrote in the past. When I've attempted to edit the code
        to adjust my website
        <strong>I've been met with nothing but heartache!</strong>
